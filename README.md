# TermBot

TermBot is a discord bot written in the c programming language.

The idea for this bot came from another program I made called Vstat which dsplays system information in your teminal like Neofetch.

To use TermBot use ">help"
Prefix ">"

Commands:
>help - sends help

>cpu - displays the CPU conponents in the TermBot server.
>mem - displays the ammount of max and free memory the TermBot server has.
